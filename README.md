# ErrorPlot
Error-bar plotting package for *Mathematica*.

As an alternative to the *ErrorBar Plotting Package* included in *Mathematica*, it allows log-scale plotting and uses a freer syntax.

## Instalation
 - Place the folder [ErrorPlot](https://github.com/Dih5/ErrorPlot/tree/deploy/) **from the deploy branch** in your Mathematica *applications* directory (try `FileNameJoin[{$InstallationDirectory, "AddOns", "Applications"}]` ).

## Usage
 - When installed, press F1 and search for the package documentation... just as it should be :-)
 - ... or go straight to `ErrorPlot/tutorial/Plotting data with error bars` for a tutorial.
 
## Development
- Content of the [master branch](https://github.com/Dih5/ErrorPlot/tree/master/) can be used as a [Wolfram Workbench](https://www.wolfram.com/products/workbench/) project.
